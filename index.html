         <h3>
            Hey there, fellow human! The name's Eduard, and I'm 19 years old and getting better with time. Yep, Juggling the wonders of high school life while embracing my coding prowess with a laid-back charm. <br><br>
            Imagine this: there's a parallel universe where I've been programming since I could barely reach the keyboard. Okay, maybe not <em>that</em> early, but I've definitely been around the coding block for a while now. I've had rendezvous with Unity, C++, and SFML. They're like old pals, you know? We've cooked up some pretty cool projects together.<br><br>
            Speaking of projects, let me introduce you to my latest brainchild, the majestic "Tranquil Waters." It's not just a game; it's my <em>magnum opus</em>. Imagine diving into a world of 3D exploration, where tranquility and adventure hold hands and frolic by the waters. If you're thinking, "Wow, that sounds like the perfect escape from reality," well, you're absolutely right. It's like taking a vacation without even leaving your room.<br><br>
            When I'm not out there coding up a storm or contemplating the intricacies of the universe, you'll find me hanging with friends, maybe catching some sunsets (and bugs) or just pondering the profound questions of life, like whether pizza is an acceptable breakfast food. <br><br>
            So there you have it, a little peek into my universe. From high school escapades to world-building through code, I'm all about the chill vibes and nerding out. Stay curious, my friend, and remember, life's too short not to explore digital realms and crack a joke or two along the way!
